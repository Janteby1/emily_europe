					<p class="center-align">
					 Before we were able to collect all our data, we first had to know what data was available, accessible and scalable. This led us to census data, data collected at the state and city level, as well as various API'sincluding Google Maps, Yelp, and Streeteasy. One key requirement, apparent from the outset, was to reference any data we collected to a particular NYC neighborhood. That meant storing data categorized at the neighborhood level. However, more often than not, data available was by geographical coordinates or zip code, leading us to create a mapping to the appropriate neighborhood. </p>
